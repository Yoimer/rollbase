after installing: 

create ROLLBASE_HOME enviroment variable: as C:\Progress\Rollbase\Pas_Instance\rollbase

change node-config.json located in C:\Progress\Rollbase\pas\rollbase\config as
it is on progress-rollbase-pas-rollbase-config folder (I am not positive about it, but let's change it)

run the scrips on the automation folder in the next order:

1) stopdb-rollbase.bat
2) startdb-rollbase.bat
3) startdb-tcman.bat

it should prompt a DOS screen always.
when installing for the first time it will take longer (it will show which part of the
installation is doing)
